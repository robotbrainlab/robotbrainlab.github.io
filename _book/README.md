# Modern AI Engineering from Zero

One book, written from zero, to prepare for AI/LLM application engineer interviews by
**31 December 2026**. Temporary by design: this repository exists for that deadline, not as a
permanent library.

It has **nothing to do with any website**. The syllabus came from the author's own research
notes; the book stands alone and never refers to a site, a roadmap or numbered steps.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Start here** | `HANDOVER.md` — decisions, state, what is blocked |
| Spec | `BOOK-GUIDE.md` |
| Table of contents | `TOC.md` |
| Chapter sources | `markdown/` (the only source of truth) |
| Lab files | `labs/` |
| Build | `latex/` — `cd latex && make` |
| Review PDF | `python3 tools/make-toc-pdf.py` — builds `TOC.pdf` from `TOC.md` in the book's own design |

## Status

| Part | Chapters | Pages | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| I · Understand — *Mental Model* | 1–7 | 98 | **Done** — 7 of 7, 2026-10-23 |
| I · Understand — *Inside the Model* | 8–17 | 168 | **Drafting** — 8 of 10 done |
| II · Use | 18–39 | 362 | Not started |
| III · Apply | 40–50 | 190 | Not started |
| IV · What Next | 51–57 | 136 | Not started |
| Appendices | A–D | 83 | **A (cheat sheet, 57 items), B (100 questions) and C (glossary, 92 terms) in the PDF.** A and C are generated from the chapters and gated; B's answers come as chapters land. D is the LaTeX index |

About 1,042 numbered pages in all. **Measure with `python3 tools/pages.py`**, which reads the
built PDF and ends each chapter where the next opener begins. Do not subtract folios by hand:
three chapters were over-counted that way (5 as 12 pp, 7 as 9, 8 as 15) because the part and
sub-part opener pages sitting after the last written chapter were counted into it. See
`LEDGER-DEFECTS.md` entry 23. From the current build:

```text
  ch    printed   pp  est  of est
   1     3-12     10   14     71%
   2    13-22     10   18     56%
   3    23-32     10   14     71%
   4    33-42     10   16     62%
   5    43-53     11   14     79%
   6    54-64     11   12     92%
   7    65-72      8   10     80%
   8    74-85     12   14     86%
   9    86-97     12   12    100%
  10    98-113    16   20     80%
  11   114-131    18   24     75%
  12   132-144    13   16     81%
  13   145-157    13   14     93%
  14   158-170    13   22     59%
  15   171-182    12   20     60%
```

**Chapters 1–15: 179 printed pages against a 240-page estimate (75%).** Chapter 9 is the only
one to land exactly on its estimate, and none has yet exceeded one.

The estimates are estimates, never targets — `BOOK-GUIDE.md` §11. Read `LEDGER-DEFECTS.md`
entry 12 before drawing any conclusion from the percentages.

Status values: *Not started* → *Drafting* → *Editing* → *Done*.

## Build

```bash
cd latex
make                                   # markdown -> chapters -> book.pdf
PAGES_MIN=600 PAGES_MAX=1000 make check
```

Needs MacTeX (`latexmk`, `xelatex`), pandoc and poppler (`pdftotext`), all already installed.
